Hello! My name is Ahmad Rafi Kannajmi, but you can call me Rafi, Najmi, or whatever you prefer. I am an undergraduate student majoring in informatics with a passion for data. I aspire to become a data professional, particularly a data engineer.

Ever since I first learned about data, I have been captivated by its potential. This excitement drives me to continuously learn and develop my skills in the field of data. I am enthusiastic about exploring new opportunities and contributing to impactful data projects.
